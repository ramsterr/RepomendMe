"""
Stage 5 of the MVP pipeline: reranking.

Three small rules, applied in order:

  1. Drop the source repo itself (defensive — we exclude it in SQL
     already, but a stale read shouldn't poison the list).
  2. Drop repos from the same owner as the source. Recommending
     sibling repos of the source is rarely useful.
  3. Enforce owner diversity — at most one repo per owner in the
     final list, to avoid "ten forks of the same project."

When `seed` is None, the list is sorted by score (highest first) so
we apply the rules against the top-scoring repos. When `seed` is set,
the candidate pool has already been shuffled — we preserve that order
so the seed actually changes which repos survive the diversity filter.
