"""
Stage 4 of the MVP pipeline: scoring.

A fixed weighted sum of the features. No ML, no blender, no
lifecycle stages. The weights are documented in WEIGHTS; tweak them
in one place.

When `tags` are provided, a new filter_cosine_sim feature is added:
the filter text ("machine learning free courses") is embedded at query
time and compared against every candidate's README embedding. This
gives semantic matching — repos about ML education score high even
if they don't have that exact tag. The feature captures the 35%
weight, with topic_overlap at 25% as the secondary signal.

When `seed` is not None, each weight is jittered by +/- 10% and the
popularity_sim weight is boosted by 3x (to surface "cooler" repos).
The jitter is deterministic — same seed = same weights.
